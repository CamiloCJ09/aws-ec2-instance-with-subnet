## Description

This repository contains the Terraform configuration to deploy and manage infrastructure in an automated way in the cloud. Terraform is an open source tool from HashiCorp that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites âœ”

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

## Steps ðŸš€

# Creating an EC2 Instance with Virtual Network (VPC) and VPC using Terraform

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of creating an EC2 instance within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and configuring the VPC using Terraform.

### Step 1: Initialize Your Terraform Configuration

1. Create a directory for your Terraform configuration if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   mkdir terraform-ec2-vpc
   cd terraform-ec2-vpc
   ```
Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) in your directory.

Initialize your Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
```
### Step 2: Define Your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Subnet
In your main.tf file, define your VPC and subnet:

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.region}"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/28"
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.vpc_name}"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.0.0/28"
  availability_zone_id    = "${var.subnet_availability_zone}"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.subnet_name}}"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create a Security Group
Define a security group in your main.tf file:
```terraform
resource "aws_security_group" "my_security_group" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  name   = "my-security-group"
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    self        = false
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    self        = false
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    self        = false

  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 8080
    to_port     = 8080
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    self        = false
  }

  egress {
    from_port        = 0
    to_port          = 0
    protocol         = "-1"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "my-security-group"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create internet gateway, route table, route-table association, and route
```terraform
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "my_Ig" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.internet_gateway_name}"
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table" "my_route_table" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.route_table_name}"
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "my_subnet_vpc_route_table_association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.my_route_table.id
}

resource "aws_route" "my_route" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.my_route_table.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.my_Ig.id
}
```

### Step 5: Launch an EC2 Instance
Define an EC2 instance resource in your main.tf file:
```
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2_instance" {
  ami                         = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type               = "${var.itype}"
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  key_name                    = "my-ssh-key"
  subnet_id                   = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [aws_security_group.my_security_group.id]
  user_data                   = file("./launch-instance.sh")
  tags = {
    Name    = "${var.ec2_instance_name}"
    project = "${var.ec2_project_name}"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Apply Your Terraform Configuration
Apply your Terraform configuration to create the resources:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
Review the proposed changes and confirm by typing yes.

### Step 7: Access Your EC2 Instance
Once the EC2 instance is created, you can access it using SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows). Use the key pair you specified in your Terraform configuration.
